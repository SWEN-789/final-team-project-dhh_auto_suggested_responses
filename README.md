# final-team-project-dhh_auto_suggested_responses

A repository containing an API service and a demo chat application to provide automatic suggested responses to messages in certain contexts. Developed to provide ease of effort particularly for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) users, but generally for all, in responding to messages from others and facilitate communication between hearing and DHH people. 

See [the service README](service/README.md) for details about and running the service that retrieves and adds suggested response messages.

See [the web-app README](web_app/README.md) for details on installing the Codeigniter framework, creating the database, and launching the web-app.

See [the documentation directory](directory) for the interview results we collected for our contextual inquiry, our Informed Consent template, the flyer we used to attempt recruiting DHH participants for our study, and the questionnaires and the results we gathered from each participant for our experiments.
